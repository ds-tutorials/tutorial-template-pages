These are instructions for installing Grav using OU Create (or Reclaim Hosting). If you are using a different hosting service, you may want to check out the [Grav installation documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/basics/installation).

## Install Grav on OU Create

If you would like to use OU Create but have not yet set up an accout, visit the [OU Create documentation](https://create.ou.edu/docs/getting-started/general-information/) to get started.

On your OU Create dashboard, select Grav from the Applications section and click **install this application**. Installation settings you will want to change are specified below. Everything else can be left as-is.

### Location

1. Choose the domain where the tutorial will be installed. You will want to pick an option that includes "https" but does not include "www." For example: `https://ds-tutorials.oucreate.com`.
2. Choose a simple name for the directory that will differentiate this tutorial from any others you create. Good practice is for the directory to be all lowercase with words separated by dashes. For example: `tableau-skyrim`.

### Settings

1. You will want a longer/more descriptive site title. For example, `tableau-skyrim` might become `Visualizing Data with Tableau`.
2. Full name should most likely be your name or the name of your institution. For example: `Digital Scholarship @ OU Libraries`.
3. Choose the email address you would like associated with the tutorial installation.
4. Make sure to pick the username and administrator password. OU Create will automatically generate a random password, so if you want to use that, make sure you know what it is first.
5. The skeleton package should be: Grav Core + Admin (Default)

### Finishing

Once you have modified the settings, go ahead and click Install.

You can then access your website directly via its address, or by going to the OU Create dashboard, clicking on My Apps under the Applications section, and finding the tutorial in the list of installed applications.

The admin panel can be accessed by clicking the 2nd link provided on the OU Create My Apps page, or by appending `/admin` to the website URL.

## Non-OU Create Installs

If you are using a different hosting service, make sure you have checked out the [Grav installation documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/basics/installation).

If your installation does not automatically come with the following plugins, you will want to add them:
- Admin Panel
- Email
- Error
- Form
- Login
- Markdown Notices
- Problems

These are all official Grav plugins.

## Basic Setup

For these instructions, you will need to go to the admin panel for your site (Website URL + `/admin`). You will also need to access the file system for you hosting service.

If using OU Create, the file system can be accessed by selecting File Manager from the Files section. Then navigate to either the domain/subdomain you installed the tutorial on, or go to the "public_html" folder (it may have a globe icon instead of a folder icon in the directory). Then select the folder/directory you set during installation.

### Update Grav

The first thing to do, once you get to the site dashboard, is update Grav. You will want to do this periodically as part of your tutorial upkeep.

1. Click the **Check for Updates** button on the top right.
2. Click **Update Grav Now** on the purple bar that appears just below (assuming is an available update). This will update your version of Grav.
3. Then click the **Update** button at the bottom right of the green Maintenance panel and click Continue when prompted. This will update any plugins or themes with available updates.
4. You can click **Check for Updates** again to doublecheck that everything is 100% up to date.

### Add Themes

The tutorial theme inherits from the theme [learn2](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-learn2) and requires that theme to work. Thus, you will need to install both Learn2 and this theme.

#### Install Learn2

1. Select **Themes** from the admin panel navigation, and then choose **Add** (button at the top right).
2. Look for the theme Learn2 and click **Install** and then **Continue**.
3. Do not bother with any of the configuration settings, and do not activate the theme.

#### Install the Tutorial Theme

1. Download the Tutorial theme (zip file) from the [tutorial theme GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheoAcker12/tutorial-template).
2. Upload the file using to your-site/user/themes using your file manager, then unzip/extract the theme.
3. Go to **Themes** in the Grav admin panel and activate the Tutorial Template theme.
4. Optional: Remove the zip file and the Quark theme from the user/themes folder.

### Add Plugins

Go to **Plugins** on the admin panel and click **Add** to add each of the following plugins:

- Admin Addon Media Rename
	- This will allow you to rename any media files you upload directly from the admin panel.
- Git Sync
	- This will allow you to sync your pages with a git repository.
	- **Note:** The configuration wizard will pop up once this is installed. You can cancel for now or jump ahead to the [plugin configuration](https://ds-tutorials.oucreate.com/tutorial-template/setup/configuration#plugin-configuration). When navigating away from the page, click **Continue** at the unsaved changes prompt.
- Highlight
	- This provides syntax highlighting for any code sections you include.
- Shortcode Core
	- This provides several useful Markdown shortcodes that add to what you can include in your tutorial.
