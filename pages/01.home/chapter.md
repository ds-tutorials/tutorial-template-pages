# Introduction

Welcome to the Digital Scholarship tutorial template!

These pages will walk you through installation (if your initial website is not yet set up), as well as everything you need to know to create and maintain a tutorial. Identical copies of these pages can be found in your initial website set up and on the [template demo website](https://www.ds-tutorials.oucreate.com/tutorial-template/). Since you will not want to keep these pages as part of your own tutorial, it is strongly recommended to bookmark the demo website for easy reference.

Do not delete this page. Change the page title to the name of your tutorial and replace the contents with introductory information for learners. See the [tutorial structure section](https://ds-tutorials.oucreate.com/tutorial-template/structure) for recommendations about what to include on the first page.

## Prerequisites

1. A platform to host Grav, which the tutorial theme is built on
2. The tutorial theme (linked to in the installation section)
3. Basics of using Grav (included in these pages)
4. Basics of using Markdown (included in these pages)
